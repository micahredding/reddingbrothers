title: If There Were No Water
---
[EGAE][GAE] (capo 5)

Moses went down to Jordan just to see what they had done
And in the morning they gathered round him, just to stand there in the sun
And as the people gathered altogether, Moses spoke why he had come
And as the chorus rang ever louder, he just stood and let it run, singing

If there were no water, there would be no mountain (4x) ...now [E G A E]
So let it flow! Let it flow! Let it flow right now! [G A E]

Israel crossed that river just a-walking to the other side
And when they all reached the shoreline they could see there in the tide
Great Moses' body lifeless, reaching for the land to come
And though his body would not move, yeah, his feet kept walking on

[chorus]

Israel marched together, carried Moses' body
To a place of reeds and set down in the water
Casket made of bullrush, coffin made of seaweed
Buried his dead body - everyone was singing
