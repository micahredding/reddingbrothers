title: Back to the Dark

[F# A B]
[Gm A# C]

POST-CHORUS

the streets are black and gold, the stairs are green and gone
the silence is a warning, waiting for the war
the doors are coming now, the walls are coming out
never gonna fall back down

raised up on high, the sun in the night
the hole in the wall, that makes this a home
the sun and the fire, the one that you are
the one that you make, the one that you want

back to the dark, back to the night, come on
back to the heart, back to the one you want
the sway of the lines, the sting of the light - the fall
back to the dark, back to the night, come on
back to the storm
come along, come on, come with us
come along, come on

back in the dark where the other ones set
in the silence of dark they made their own beds
in berlin the way, the wall that they found
was just another one that's gone

it's the step by the step that made it okay
the walkway, the well, the fire and the paint
the green and the gone, the flecks that remain
that led you along the wall that said...everyone

CHORUS
POST-CHORUS

back to the dark, the place where they met you
no other one would dare forget you
back to the dark, the place where no other comes

the streets feel like home, the silence is red
the walls of your room, like sheets on the bed
the walls feel like warm, the air has the feel
the ceiling's about to fall

CHORUS
silence is golden, silence is gold
silence is golden, silence is cold

CHORUS
POST-CHORUS
