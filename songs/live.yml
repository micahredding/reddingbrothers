[G C, Em D C]

I don't know why there has to be
So much...needless suffering...for me
I don't know why I have to do
Anything that I don't want to...(for you)

[G D C D]

I don't know a better thing
Than doing just what I have seen
I don't know what I would do
But I can tell you, I can tell you
Somebody (better) hold me tight
And get me through this long night

[Em D C]
That's when I'll open up my mind

[G D C]
I want to live like there will be no tomorrow
I want to live like there was no yesterday
I want to live like there's no such thing as sorrow

[Em D C D]
Til sorrow comes and breaks us, and takes our hearts away
...I want to stay

I don't know why I've been told
Everyone must get old, it seems
I just want to break the mold
Living in my own little world of dreams

I don't know a better thing
Than doing just what I have seen
I don't know what I would do
But I can tell you, I can tell you
Somebody (better) hold me tight
And get me through this long night
That's when I'll open up my mind


I want to live like there will be no tomorrow
I want to live like there was no yesterday
I want to live like there's no such thing as sorrow
Til sorrow comes and breaks us, and takes our hearts away
