title: Stairway To The Sun
notes: |
  At our official monthly band "business" meeting on Tuesday, we all decided we wanted to start co-authoring and collaborating more than we currently do, and this week we got to try it out for the first time in awhile.

  Basically I woke up on Wednesday morning with the instrumental tracks to this song going through my head. I went down stairs that morning, before anyone else got up, and recorded a vocal-interpretation of the 3 background melodies (my pathetic attempt at mimicking the main synth, synth lead, and lead guitar â€” I might post the clip later). Today, Gabe helped me get past the technical aspects of laying down the actual instrument tracks for the song (synth, synth lead, bass, drums, and lead guitar), and put together the main structure. Then, Micah and I put our heads together for the lyrics (mainly Micah's credit), and finished it up at about 5:00 p.m. From then on, me and Gabe worked on the lead vocal and harmony, and then he finished up mixing and mastering at about 10:30, 35 minutes ago.
