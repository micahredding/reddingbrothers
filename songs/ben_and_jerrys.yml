title: Ben and Jerry's
---
Cherry Garcia would you marry me?
In some crazy fairy-tale mixed-up fantasy
Of mine — I'll be your kind
I'll be kind — You be mine

If I make it past the intro
Will you stay?


We might be nuts
But there will be others
Who may share our taste in butters
We may be crazy
But we'll be delicious
In our favorite pair of dishes

Stand on the corner
Not in the shadows
Someone may wander into our shallows
Raspberry cordial — that sounds delicious

I'm Hazed and Confused
but you'll be delicious
Caught between me and our favorite dishes
Your Blondie Ambition makes it all matter
A Swirled of Difference

Blow out the candles
Make your three wishes
I'll bring the spoon — You bring the dishes
I get confused
Are we nutritious?
I know someone sure does miss us


Bald men with beards

I'm Hazed and Confused
but you'll be delicious
And food for so much more than Phishes

You'll be my Ben
I'll be your Jerry
You'll be my chocolate
I'll be your cherry

And we'll take this all the way
What a taste! they'll say
And we'll take this all the way
We won't make this mistake
