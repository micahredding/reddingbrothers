title: Fine

[G]Living with the worst uncomfort [C]I don't ever want to feel
[Em]Living til the drop shadows [C]turn to something more real
[G]Won't you tell me all your secrets, [C]in the end you're going to find
[EM]Dust unsettles every past, [C]Clear it now, relieve your mind
[G]Bring it all to life unsettled, [C]listen to the wind wind
[EM]I believe in honesty, [C]Honesty believes in lies

[I wanna [G]say, wherever you [C]go, I will be [EM]with you [D]in your [C]soul
I wanna [G]say, whatever you [C]find, I will be [EM]with you [D]in your [C]mind
[C]And I will be, I will be, I will be [G]fine]

[G]Living on the other side, [C]I wanted just to cross the fence
[Em]Lurking in the dark shadows, [C]live the life that I've lived since
[G]I wanted to find a way to [C]meet between dividing lines
[Em]Understand the whole fully, [C]fulfill all the holes in mine
[G]Believe, on the other side, I [C]wanted to come back again
[Em]Just like how I played up life, [C]then regained my innocence
[G]Lurking in the dark shadows, [C]Questions that you wouldn't find
[Em]Living where the light glares, [C]living on the other side

[chorus]

[EM]Won't you tell me all your secrets, [D]I'll cover up yours with mine
[C]Listen to the restless blurring [D]of our latest border-lines
[EM]Finally all the dust settles, [D]never just to rise again
[C]Believe in my shameless past, [D]I'll believe you're innocent

[chorus]
