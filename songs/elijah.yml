The father puts his son to sleep, the still small voice is the one they keep
And together the whole world can see that peace runs pure and free
Then the beacon that beams out from Rome, and crosses waves and overcomes
Is the beacon that shines back to home, from deep unto deep

[Am]Behold [G]I [C]come, when the [G]days grow [Am]long
And the lights grow dim, turning hearts back home

Then night is falling here on earth, the son's own life is understood
And people live it constantly, knowing what they see
The reflection of the father-son has found itself in everyone
The world is just the father's own, the house finally made home

CHORUS
