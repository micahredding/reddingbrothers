snow-globe, don't you know enough to question
everything that you find?
snow-globe, don't you know enough to question
everything in your mind?

there are [C]grass-stains in my [G]hair
and i can't [Am]perceive it [D]yet
don't you [C]know it will [G]snow in [Am]time? [D]
there are grass-stains in my hair
and i can't perceive it yet
don't you know it will snow in time?

[C]it's hard [G]enough to question [Am]my [G]indiscretions
[C]it's not [G]enough to tell you [Am]why
it's hard enough to question my indiscretions
and i wonder if it's time
