title: Tired and Thrilled
---
I won't be happy and filled - I won't be happy and filled
I won't be tired and thrilled - I won't be tired and thrilled

You want me to step back and see - The way you want it to be
You want me to just stand aside - And watch it all pass by
You think I'm sorry will find - A way to let it slip by
You think I'll stand by the side - With my half-clouded eyes

I won't be happy and filled - I won't be happy and filled
I won't be tired and thrilled - I won't be tired and thrilled

You break your pretty little things - Over my knees
You break your pretty little heart - In front of my eyes
You take your time, rub it in - Until I can't stand your scent
You take your pretty little face - Make it the biggest lie

I won't be happy and filled - I won't be happy and filled
I won't be tired and thrilled - I won't be tired and thrilled

So don't step back and think that you can do the things you want
Just because you don't believe in having something that I don't
You can't believe, you can't believe, you can't believe in me
You deceive us both, but you just can't deceive me

I'm not forgetful, not a liar, not a fool for you
Not a little toy to use for all your petulant moods
Not a plaything, or somebody's prisoner
You may be the Queen, but I'm the executioner
