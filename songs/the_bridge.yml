VERSE 1:
Feel the rain tap-tapping on my front door
Hear the thunder and the wind coming cross the moor
Smell the air and the waves crashing on the shore
Cause I'm never gonna see you anymore

I saw your daddy at the corner just the other day
I think he saw me but he hurried and walked away
Now I'm trying hard just to make it all go away
Cause I'm never gonna see your pretty face

CHORUS:
So I won't make it across that bridge today
But I won't mind this bitter cold
My frozen eyes chasing unseen lies
Chase my dreams till they're gone
Chase my dreams till they're gone

VERSE 2:
Your mamma said boy get your things and go
And don't ya be coming here anymore
I walked to the bridge and I thought for sure
You'd say something to make me go on home

CHORUS

Took off my gloves, laid them on the rail
My boots were stuck, tied the laces well
The wind was blowing hard and cold
Never gonna take those boots back home

CHORUS
