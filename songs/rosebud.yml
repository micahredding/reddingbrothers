[E1] another live reporter
[A3] the devil's [A1] own
[E1] another millionaire child
[A3] fortunate [A1] son

sold his [A5] soul to the people when [A1] he was eighteen
lost the [A5] light in his candle - filled [A1] up with prestige
[A5] long lay the shadows that [A1] come by your door
when you [A3] can't remember me no [A1] more

[CHORUS]
[E1] i don't wanna be another [A3] cold light - blowing [A1] out the candles just to [A5] shine in the night
filling [A1] life up with other [A3] excuses to love - just [A1] another reach for the [A3] light of the [A5] rose

all of those pretty faces
and you picked me
force me into your mold
trying to set me free

saw the sign on the window and wanted much more
left the phone on the cradle when you rushed out the door
newspapers can't print this truth
the truth hurts the worst when coming from you

[CHORUS]

just a little glance back every now and then
lost the future in the past, try remembering when
all my collections gather dust, around me all the dreams rust
listen to the rhythm of the printing machine
telling all the people what it all really means

[CHORUS]
