E1
another live reporter
A3     A1
the devil's own
E1
another millionaire child
A3     A1
fortunate son

A5				A1
sold his soul to the people when he was eighteen
A5				A1
lost the light in his candle - filled up with prestige
A5				A1
long lay the shadows that come by your door
A3			A1
when you can't remember me no more

E1		A3			A1		       A5
i don't wanna be another old light - blowing out the candles just to shine in the night
A1			A3		A1	         A3			A5
filling life up with other excuses to love - just another reach for the light of the rose


all of those pretty faces
and you picked me
force me into your mold
trying to set me free

saw the sign on the window and wanted much more
left the phone on the cradle when you rushed out the door
newspapers can't print this truth
the truth hurts the worst when coming from you

just a little glance back every now and then
lost the future in the past, try remembering when
all my collections gather dust, around me all the dreams rust
listen to the rhythm of the printing machine
telling all the people what it all really means



i don't wanna be another old light - blowing out the candles just to shine in the night
filling life up with other excuses to love - just another reach for the light of the rose
just another dip in what life often brings - long hard choices in a strong cold breeze
