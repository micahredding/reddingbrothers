It's how I feel when I'm hopeless
It's how I feel when I'm looking at the world
It's how I feel when I'm tired
Of the damage you've earned

It's how I feel when I'm broken
Wondering if I will find again
How I feel when I'm chained down
Like I never could win

It's how I feel when I'm angry
It's how I feel when the Walls came down
It's how I feel when I'm conquered
By the one that you've found

[It's how I overcame evil
It's how I tore down the walls of Jericho
How I gave up the light, before I gave up my ghost
It's how I broke through the silence
It's how I left you to walk alone no more
How I gave up my life from before I was born]

It's how I feel when I'm hopeless
It's how I feel when I'm sad and lone no more
It's how I feel when in torment
My eyes on the door

It's how I feel when I'm tired
Tired of beating rain that comes
And when I know
Somehow you'll be gone

[It's how I overcame evil
It's how I tore down the walls of Jericho
How I gave up the light, before I gave up my ghost
It's how I broke through the silence
It's how I gave up the one I was to know
How I gave up my life from before I was born]
