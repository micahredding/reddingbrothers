title: LeBaron
author: Gabriel Redding
notes: |
  Before we ever had a band, we had the LeBaron convertible, the most worn-out awesomest convertible ever. It leaked when it rained, and sometimes it didn't work, but driving around with the top down and the air conditioner on full-blast was a Summer experience not to be missed.

Cherry ice and thaw it all
LeBaron drive the whole
2581 miles left to go.
Well the tire's got a hole
no not one, it's all four
I've never slept on the hood before.
Wash liquid frozen
near dead in Wyoming.
It seem we're stuck, but hey! Keep going!

(Chorus) Keep going on! Drag the world along! Never stop until we get to everything!

(Bridge) Feel me empower earth as the day goes
Feel it come to a stop because I said so.
And I really think for sure
I am the only one in awe at all, awe at all.
Am I just the only one to find awe in the everything he knows?
