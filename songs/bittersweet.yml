title: Bittersweet
---
Look at the shadows overhead
Look at your intuition broken by a silver thread
Look at the sad between the lights
Look at the sun - here comes the sky!

CHORUS: I see the bittersweet in the dead of night

Oh why don't you get outside my mind
Oh and leave me there
Oh why don't you break this timid line
Between my feeble eyes and all the light

I wanted to break, I wanted to take, everything away from my feeble mind
I wanted to say, I wanted to lay, on the corner looking at the outside
Watch the cars pass by, on the other side, looking alive and feeling tired
A blizzard of lights, the train's on time, riding hot and running wild!

CHORUS

Take a piece of me, hope it's what you need, mix it up with little bit of decency
For the morning sun, find that all is done, in the middle of the day before the night comes
Spinning out of my time, to the other side, raising my rent and trying to fly
Make ends tight, I feel the light, piercing through my broken eyes

CHORUS

Don't leave me here alone
Don't leave me here broken up and tired

CHORUS
