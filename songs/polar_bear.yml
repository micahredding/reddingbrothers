title: Polar Bear Song
---
[G] If you were a [D] polar bear, and [C] I were a [D] grizzly bear
[G] There would still be [D] something that [C] both us bears could [D] share
Cause [G] when we get [D] together, there's [C] one thing we both [D] crave
[G] Just to be [D] wrapped up - [C] inside a warm dark [D] cave

CHORUS:
I want to [G] hibernate with [D] you somewhere - Where [C] we can be [D] together
[G] Hibernate with [D] you somewhere - [C] Inside a warm dark [D] cave
I want to [G] Hibernate with [D] you somewhere - and [C] spend our lives [D] forever
[G] Put my bear-claw [D] around you and [C] just [D] hibernate, hibernate...

Oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh oh

[G D C D]

If I were to climb a tree, and see all the things that I could see, well
It just wouldn't be the same if you're not there with me
So climb on up, take my hand, we'll roam all over bear-land
And find a place where we can rest peacefully...

[CHORUS]
