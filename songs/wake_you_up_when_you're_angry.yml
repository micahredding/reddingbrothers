title: Wake You Up When You're Angry
---
[D]
Hands are reaching out, feet are feeling down
Eyes are taking in the world around
All this comes to light, all this comes tonight
Feel it all rush in, the world around

[A# F G D]
[Wake you up when you're angry
Wake you up when you're overcome
Wake you up when you're chasing
Babylon]

Wake you up when you're FADEing
Wake you up when you're holding dreams
Wake you up when you're TAKing
Lie to these

hands are tasting breath, feet are feeling depth
feel it on your skin - the world around
walls are coming down, ceiling coming down
feel it all rush in, the world around

CHORUS

Hands are reaching out, feet are feeling down
Eyes are taking in the world around
All this comes to light, all this comes tonight
Feel it all rush in, the world around
