I built a castle - And I built a wall
And watched it stand strong and beautiful in the sun
With hammers and nails, I made it stand so tall
I built a castle of sand

Built a house on a hill
I built a wall to keep it still
Built a gate to let you in
And a quarters to keep you in

I built a road, a pathway up
To carry you up to my home
I built a lake, and made it long

Call to the wind! Get you back where you belong
You don't take chances when you leave - No, you ruined my dreams
Woman, you're good - you made it seem like I could finally be the king
Then you step away, take a step
And watch me fall

I built the moon, colored it white and the color of you
Blue and black in a painted sky
Made dark and glorious in the night
It was so perfect you could see
The light shading down on everything
All you know is that I made it all for you

[CHORUS]

It's all over now, it's all I can talk about
It's all over now ...[fade away]
