title: Move Along
---
Move, move along
A little noise, on your way to sound
Move, move your arms
Go on make the noise, thatâ€™ll let you out

Underneath the light there'll be the cold
Underneath the night there'll be the day
Underneath the path there'll be the road
Underneath the sign there'll be the gate

Underneath the fire there'll be the glow
Underneath the dark you'll find a way
Underneath the new there'll be the old
Underneath the touch you'll find the taste

**
A little farther then you fade away - keep it in motion
A little farther then you hesitate - keep it moving
A little farther then you gasp for air - barely breathing
A little farther then you're finally clear - keep it in motion
A little farther then you fade, a little farther then you fade away
**
