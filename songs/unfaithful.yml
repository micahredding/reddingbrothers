[D]didn't [A]save my mind for [E]you
didn't [F#m]save my body
[D]though i [A]told you in your [E]room
you're my [F#m]one and only

[D]i've been [A]broke so many [E]times
all the [F#m]cracks run through me
[D]i was [A]searching for you [E]then
i just [F#m]wandered from it

[D]but i've got [A]one last gift to [E]give, one last [F#]box to open here
[D]one last [A]thing no one can [E]take...[F#]away
and [D]i have [A]saved it all for [E]you...[F#]
and [D]i have [A]saved it all for [E]you...[F#]

[D]i will [A]save my tears for [E]you, locked up [F#]deep inside my [D]room
in a [A]secret place you'll [E]find, that even [F#]i can never [D]lose
i will [A]save my tears for [E]you, all i've got [F#]left inside me
[D]broken [A]walls and broken [E]doors no one [F#]else can ever [D]see

[D][A][E][F#]

[D]i've turned up [A]dirty at your [E]door
like a [F#m]drunken beggar
[D]you took me [A]in and washed my [E]wounds
it only [F#m]made them deeper

[D]nameless [A]faces in a [E]crowd
of the [F#m]ones that weren't you
[D]stole the [A]gifts i had to [E]give
left an [F#m]imprint on me

[D]yeah, i've got [A]one last deepest [E]place, it wasn't [F#]all for nothing
[D]i've kept our [A]broken dreams and [E]flower [F#]vase
and [D]i will [A]save one last for [E]you...[F#]
and [D]i will [A]save one last for [E]you...[F#]

[D]i will [A]save my tears for [E]you, locked up [F#]deep inside my [D]room
in a [A]secret place you'll [E]find, that even [F#]i can never [D]lose
i will [A]save my tears for [E]you, all i've got [F#]left inside me
[D]broken [A]walls and broken [E]doors no one [F#]else can ever [D]see

[D][A][E][F#]

[D]you thought i [A]gave them all [E]away...[F#]
[D]but i've got [A]one last left for [E]you...
