title: Climbing Up My Mountain
---
place my foot down, first step taken to the top of it
reaching higher, finger on rung
stretching for greatness, i can see it, almost taste it
climbing for heaven from the ground i'm from

let it flow, let my instincts take over my reaching
let it wander, don't let my fingers falter
holding on, to let it all go
holding all, gotta let it all flow

[climbing up my mountain
feeling my endless confidence
climbing up my mountain
let it go

climbing up my mountain
feeling no strong resistance
climbing up my mountain
let it go]

turn my head down, come back into my confidence
everything spins sideways, and I see right down
my hands are reaching, pleading with the feeble rungs
to grasp my trembling fingers, back from the void

let it flow, let my instincts take over my reaching
let it wander, don't let my fingers falter
holding on, to let it all go
holding all, gotta let it all flow

CHORUS
