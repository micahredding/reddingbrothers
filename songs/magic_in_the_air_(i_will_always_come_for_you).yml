title: I Will Always Come To You (Magic in the Air)
---
take this heart, take this satellite of gold
take this box, all the pieces it can hold
take this board, where i carved the secret truth
as i swore, i will always come for you

move along, sweat made magic in my veins
beneath the sun, lines and creases cross my face
on a road, press my fingers to the place
in the dust, where the gravel meets the grave

take these hands, wrap them in these silver threads
take my head, lay it down and don't forget
on a stone, feel it rough behind my neck
to the bone, lay it down and don't forget (3x)

oh oh, press the walls and i come through
oh oh, moving on my way to you
oh oh, i see magic in this noise
oh oh, see myself inside the void

oh oh, i see magic in the air
oh oh, i see magic in the air
oh oh, rising through the atmosphere
oh oh, i see magic in the air

take these hands, feel that they are open wide
feel these wounds, the skin taken from my side
see my eyes, my blood running in my face
like i promised, i came all this way to you (3x)

CHORUS

Like I promised, I will always come for you
Like I promised, I will always come for you
Like I promised, I will always come for you
Like I promised, I will always come for you
