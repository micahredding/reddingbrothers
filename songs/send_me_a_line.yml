title: Send Me A Line
chords: "G D Em C ???"

We headed out together into the endless night
Heedless of any weather, Looking for someplace new
We'll find a place that's better, Where we'll be endlessly
We left our lamps burning out in the streets

We left the fire glowing, We left the doors open
We left the drapes pulled, Turned on the pilot light
We left the phone ringing, We left the kettle singing
Lit a match and watched the flames lick the sky

[Send me a line, fill it with time and
You want to go home, but you're feeling alone
Lost in your mind, one step behind and
You want to go home, but you're feeling alone]

Another turning point, another reason why
Lost somewhere inside myself I find myself behind the lines
Another big mistake, another road to take
Somewhere someone's never going to find me

We headed cross the ocean into the shadow-land
So many faces here I can't recall which one I am
We never compromised, Lived for the moment then
We left the world just shaking with indifference
We broke the sacred windows stained by holy fights
A silhouette of wonder tracing through the sky
We broke the bricks open, opened the brick ovens
The smell of grave-clothes burning in the Summer night
