girl im just a lonely old man
sitting with my favorite loafers on
living in a perfect neighborhood
where everything’s right, nothing goes wrong

i just don't want to be lonely anymore
and crawl inside my head again
but if it's a bad day no one will see me
slipping off to make-believe land

[it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
would you be, could you be
it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
would you be, could you be my neighbor...
could you be my neighbor]

if no one else notices me today
my imaginary friends, they'll still care
but i just want to reach out and touch someone
just to know they're really there

[chorus]

i'll put my favorite sweater on
and sit here by the telephone all day
but if it's a bad day again
i'll take this trolley to make-believe land

[chorus]
