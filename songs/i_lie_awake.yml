title: I Lie Awake
---
Wretched pieces of me lie awake
On my pillow of scars
Broken promises and pretty face
My ceiling made of stars

The walls descend into the angry waves
The sheet lifts up into the night
A thousand reasons why I'm not afraid
Debris of heaven fills the sky

I lie awake, I lie awake (rpt)

Ripped from my place in myself
Into the tunnel of light
Vortex of beauty and dark
Somewhere between earth and sky

I lie awake, I lie awake (rpt)

A thousands strangers look up
Into the night, in the sky
I drift into the ether
My thousand pieces collide

I lie awake, I lie awake
