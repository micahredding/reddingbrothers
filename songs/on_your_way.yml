title: On Your Way
---
there's no one to love here tonight
there's no one to love here tonight
and even if there ever were, you wouldn't change your mind
there's no one to love here tonight

seems like you're the only one, you're the only one on your way
seems like you're the only one, you're the only one on your way

tonight, you're going to call it off
tonight, we're going to watch it fall
tonight, you're going to call it off
tonight, we're going to watch it fall so slowly
