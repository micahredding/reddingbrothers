I fell a little, I feel a little forward.
I lit a little fire.

I lit fire, I feel the fire furrow,
I fail a few more wiles.

I fail the wiles, fall through to understatement
Feel like I'm gonna try.

I'm gonna try, I don't really wanna try.
That's why I'm feeling the fall.

It's all the distance that I'm gonna pull.
It's all the distance. That's been understood.

Oooooooo

It's all in my head
it's all in my stead.

Huh?
Hey!
