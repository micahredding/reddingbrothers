title: Gravity (I Will Take You In These Arms)
---
[Em] We are [GC] separated, [Em] By a [G] great [C] divide
Between you and [D] I......But [Em] it's [G] alright, we'll [C] make it
Cause I will [Em] cover it [C] all, [Em] cover it [C] all
I'll make you [G] mine

[[G] I will [C] take you, [Em] in these arms!
[G] I will [C] make you, [Em] in these arms
What I [D] need, in these arms! [G] ]

Like the star burning the night
In the fire of endless sky, So me...
Come burning, burning to me

Like the bird that flies toward the sun
Sees himself and downward he comes, To me
Come falling, falling to me

[[G] I will [Em] take you, [C] in these arms!
[G] I will [Em] make you, [C] in these arms
What I [D] need, is in these [G] arms!

You will stay here, in these arms!
In this place here, in these arms
What I need, is in these arms!]

There can be no separation
There can be no borderline [great divide]  [dividing line]
There can be no you and me
In these arms tonight

[I will take you, in these arms!
I will make you, in these arms
What I need...

I will take you, in these arms!
I will make you, in these arms
I will take you, in these arms!
I will make you, in these arms
You will stay here, in these arms!
In this place here, in these arms

What I need, is in these arms!]

[G] Gravity will [C] bring us together, a [G] million miles, it [C] doesn't matter
[G] Gravity will [C] take us farther, [Em] on and on and on and on...
[G] Gravity will [C] bring us together, [Em] spinning faster [C] than any other
[G] Gravity will [C] make us each other, [Em] melt us [D] into [C] one
[Em] melt us [D] into [C] one...
