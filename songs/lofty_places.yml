You put me up in lofty places, say/ command disunity/
erstwhile you searched for cession of your enmity.
You put me up in lofty places, say/ leave everything to me/
just 'cause you can give commands don't mean you can lead.

[And I won't ever kneel/ I won't ever fight/
I won't ever heed/ and I won't ever run, I won't ever run.]

You put me up in lofty places, say/ Curses the way you feel/
just deal with what you're told to and you'll upset nil.
You put me up in lofty places, say/ you must give in to me/
Forget your love, hope, morals, and your dignity.

You put me up in lofty places, say/ You won't give in and yet/
I feel your weakness coming, it's at the door at best.
You put me up in lofty places, say/ you have mistaken me/
I am the stone foundation, you're not moving me!

I won't ever run...I won't ever run...You know that...I won't ever  run...
