title: Mirror On The Wall
---
[E5 - E3, E5 A7]
You can come down on the rows to take me - under the eaves I can fall
Under the lights you come to get me - It's you after all
I'll be running down the staircase - You'll be coming in the door
I'll be running for the cellar when you hit the floor

[E5 E3]
I'll be your mirror - on the wall
I'll be your mirror - carousel
I'll be your mirror - come and get me
I'll be your mirror

You're so vain you can take the money
You're so proud you can take the fall
You're so evil you'll stick together
Yourself and the wall

You just can't see it like I see it
Your face, it broke the camel's straw
Your skin seeps love and condescension
Out of us all
