title: Shoulder
chords: (G C Em C) capo 5
notes: |
  Sometimes, to express intense emotion in my songs, I utilize words to describe intensity. Like "anger", for example. In that song, the word "anger" is used to express glory so intense it hurts.

  In this song, "mistake" is used to express the concept of opening a pandora's box. Things are mistakes when the results of them are not able to be fathomed or dealt with.

  "Angry", "hurt", and such, are used in this song in similar ways.

She's like winter on the window
She's like fire in the night
She's a mistake I remember
For a thousand sleepless nights

Frozen tundra of my memories
Broken only by her hurt
Lifts her shadow up to heaven
Casts her body down to earth

[On my shoulder when I'm happy
On my shoulder when I cry
Lost myself in times of trouble
Ten thousand angry years go by]

And the smell of glory on her
Bright and blowing towards my sight
Shine of everything I've ever known
Bursting on me, eroding ice

Lost at times I follow sleeping
I would dream of another face
On my shoulder, But it won't be keeping
Me up at night, keeping me awake

CHORUS

In the corner if you reach me
In the corner if I stand
I'll be happy just to follow
I'll be happy for a hand

CHORUS
