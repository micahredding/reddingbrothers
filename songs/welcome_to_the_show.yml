INTRO:
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show
Sights to behold and wonders to pursue
No one knows but you, no one knows but you

Welcome, welcome to the show
I am you and you are gone
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the show
I am you and you are gone

VERSE 1:
Ladies and gentlemen, please - avert your attention -- Focus it all on the center light
See the stagemaster enter the ring -- Feel it all come into the sight
Animals, menageries, scenes fill the stage -- Let it all collapse
Ford it all like a restless wave -- Let it all come back

Ladies and gentlemen, please focus
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention is dear
Give me your hands, lend me your eyes
Let it all collide...

...In a scene, in a scene, in a scene, in a scene
In a scene - beautiful sights to behold!
In a scene - beautiful sights to behold!
In a scene - beautiful lies in the cold
In a scene - facedown when you go
...In a scene, in a scene, in a scene, in a scene

PRE:
Focus your attention on the center light
Focus your attention on the border line
Ladies and gentlemen, please fill the stage
Ladies and gentlemen, please fill the stage
Let all your outside cares slip away
Let it all go and let it all stay

CHORUS:
No society outside these doors!
No world outside these words!
Gonna lie down in the cold
Day is night and night is day
Day is night and night is day
Ladies and gentlemen, take the stage!

POST:
Gonna let it go, gonna let it go right now
Gonna let it go, gonna let it go right down
And when you open your mind, you'll see a brand new place
And when you open your eyes, you'll see a brand new face!

VERSE 2:
There's no outside but this outside
There's no space but this space
The centered lights are calling out
Three rings of circled lace

You broke it all, you let it go, You let it go right down
You bring it all up here today, you bring it all somehow
You're terrified, you're terror-made, you're terraformed and terrafraid
Your terror-point of no torrade, your terror-phone - oh no!

Gonna let it go, gonna let it go right now
Gonna let it go, gonna let it go right down
Gonna let it go, gonna let it go right now
Gonna let it go, gonna let it go right down
