title: Harvest Time Is Coming
chords: D G
---
Across the fields the fire glows
The music rise, the pretty clothes
Come streaming over every road
And falling into lines

The debutante she checks her dress
For one last time to look her best
She'll dance herself to decadence
Before she says goodbye

HARVEST TIME

She twirls around the center light
The sentiment, the gentle eyes
They're spinning her away tonight
Then bring her back around

The pretty girl for one last time
She knows she's got to save the light
And tries to memorize each step
Remembering the lines

...And every boy in town would love to escort her
...Every boy in town would love to be her guide
...And every boy in town comes out to walk beside her
...Every boy in town is walking down the aisle

HARVEST TIME
...AND IF
HALLELUJAH
HARVEST TIME

They sing to her and choose the tune
They find the fierceness in them too
They make for one last night before they try

...Singing if tonight we dine, we dine as men
...Singing if tonight we dine, we dine as men
...Singing if tonight we dine, we dine as men
...Singing if tonight we dine, we dine as men

HALLELUJAH2
SEE HOW THEY RUN

=============================================

PRECHORUS // HARVEST TIME
[Harvest time is coming, harvest time is coming
Harvest time is coming, harvest time is coming]

PRECHORUS2 // ...AND IF
[And if the sun hasn't met you yet, then you're better off running
Harvest time, harvest time is here]

CHORUS // HALLELUJAH
[Hallelujah, ready or not you come
Hallelujah, the saints are coming home
Hallelujah, you're taking the final bow
Hallelujah, the ends are ending now]

CHORUS2 // HALLELUJAH2
[Hallelujah, ready or not you come
Hallelujah, the saints are coming home
Hallelujah, you're raging against the dark
Hallelujah, you're ready for who you are]

[See how they run!
Oh holy one]

~~~And everyone drinks their punch
~~~The fire makes them ever-drunk
