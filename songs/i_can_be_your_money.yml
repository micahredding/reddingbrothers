title: I Can Be Your Money
---
I wander easily
My mind's a runaway
At first you lean towards me
And then you lean away
You talk to other guys
My hands begin to shake
And then you laugh again
My choice is made for me

[Where You Go I can Be Your Money
Where You Go I can Be Your Friend
Where You Go I can Be Your Only One Until The End
One Until the End]

You can't express yourself
I can't be no one else
You don't know what to say
I give myself away
I tell you all the things
I don't want you to see
And while you hide away
You know the truth of me

Oh oh I can't tell you're listening
I can hear what your voice isn't telling
You either like me or can't wait to leave me
You either know me or can't stand to see me

Oh oh I can't tell you're listening
I can hear what your voice isn't telling
You're either near or falling away from me
You're either far or my eyesight is fading

[Where You Go I can Be Your Money
Where You Go I can Be Your Friend
Where You Go I can Be Your Only One Until The End
One Until the End]
