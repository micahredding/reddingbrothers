[C G Am F]

[C] A long time ago, a nation [G] very far away
Young men [Am] stood on a hillside, dreaming [F] of another day
They never [C] knew what this would lead to, all these [G] visions, all these things,
All they [Am] knew was that they'd never lose the [F] power of the dream

A thousand years later and a million miles since
You can still hear them coming, hear their voices in the wind
A million different cities where the people cried aloud
They knew the change was coming in the clouds

CHORUS:
[C] It [G] came in the [Am] clouds that [F] day
Throwing open heaven's gates
coming in on the winds of change
The day it all came down
That day was filled with clouds

They saw a new heaven and earth
A new birth, new universe born right here on the earth
They knew that if this was to happen everything would have to change
They'd bring the revolution and the day

[chorus]

The change they knew was coming never took them by surprise
But lifted them unspoken with the wind into the skies
And now, you can hear their voices, all eternity they cry,
Immortal, they're a beacon in the sky

[chorus]
