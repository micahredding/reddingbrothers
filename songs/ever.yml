(Verse 1)
Can you make out the sound?
It's your own voice,
It's pretty loud these days.
Don't open up if you don't want it.
All I think I know I know I know I know!

(Chorus)
Hear the lowly feud/ and it complicates the room.
Humid atmosphere just went to 102.
I approach the terms / you think I'll say a lonely word.
This might be the best thing you've ever heard.
This might be the best thing you've ever heard.

(Verse 2)
Don't lose what I say/
Always just remember.
Glue it to your bedroom wall.
You know a tack won't keep it there.
I know.
