title: A Fight's a Dance
---
Violence lends to violent deeds
The strong commend, and others seek
And left alone we all can see
The violence in our hands

The eyes of fate, The light of death
The hope of all that can't regret
And everything that hasn't yet
Our violence still will stand

[A Fight's A Dance of Different Needs
A strong romance of blood and beast
And I won't stand for anything
That doesn't end gracefully]

ahhh...

Violence is as violence does
The wicked shout the world above
And never known a mother's love
That's silently released

And consequently rest assured
That those who've seen, but haven't heard
That all they are - they will endure
And never shall cease

CHORUS x 2

All we are...
All we are is what we were
All we are...is here on earth

Ah ah ah...
What we are is what we were
All we are...is here on earth

CHORUS x 3

All we are...
All we are is what we were
All we are...is here on earth

Ah ah ah...
What we are is what we were
All we are...is here on earth
