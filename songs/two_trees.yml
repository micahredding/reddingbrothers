title: Two Trees
---
You gave me life, you gave me hope
You gave me breath so I can cope

You gave me love, you gave me power
You gave me flame from the nearest star
Wherever you are - There you are

I gave myself away
I gave my wonderment
I gave my regalness
For experience

I'm gonna work this ground
I'm gonna run it dry
I'm gonna till the earth
For the day I died

Two trees diverged in a road
I took the ones that I didn't know
Everyone followed me down that road
And that made all the difference

You came and tempted me
Discerning my design
I threw myself away
For my eager eyes

I walk this road alone
Ten thousand in my tracks
A tree to take us here
A tree to take us back

Two trees diverged in a road
I took the ones that I didn't know
Everyone followed me down that road
And that made all the difference
