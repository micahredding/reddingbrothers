i wrote this song just the other day
tell me what you think about the words
it's an expression of all i did today
so don't be cruel and don't be hard

i'm very sensitive about everything
so please don't listen to the beat
don't listen to the rhythm or the words
just listen to the melody

don't listen to the words, just count the rhythm
and listen to the rhythm and listen to the beat
don't listen to the rhythm or the words
just listen to the melody

[if you look into these words you'll find my heart
hidden away somewhere in there
stuck between the first and second chorus
of the third and fourth verse, you'll find my nightmares]

there's a little piece of me stuck on every single word
and i won't change one
just like changing my soul
just like changing it all
it just can't be done

everything inside of me rests on this next song i write
as it drifts away towards the outside
and i lose control, lose a piece of my soul
till you're satisfied

CHORUS

look into this verse, read between the lines
and you'll finally see
i come crawling out between the cracks
read between the lines, and you'll see me
