title: Sleep Away
---
were you there
when i saw you
standing there
on the distant shore

did you know
that i was angry with you
and i knew you wanted
so much more

in the fire
burns a flame
the mystery of wanting
to know your name

if it ceases
who will see?
as you drift off
into your dreams

[sleep away, my baby
sleep away, my little girl
sleep away, i know it's crazy
sleep away, you're all i wanted and more]

beneath the water
deeper still
deeper than the deepest
wishing well

how many wishes
could there be
beneath the water's
icy crystal gleam

CHORUS

in your hands
you hold the key
to the secrets i've
wanted in my sleep

would you wake
from your dreams
raise your hands
and sanctify me?

CHORUS
