title: Coming Round
---
[G D C]

[G] See the [D] waves of [C] sound
[G] And you’re [D] coming [C] now
[G] See the [D] waves of [C] wind
You come my [G] way...take me [D] on [C] again

See the mountains high
See the starry night
Turn the wind around
You take me then and take me now

And oh you’re coming ‘round

[G] I [D] want to be there
[C] when you [D] cry aloud
[G] I [D] want to be there
[C] And I [D] want to shout
[G] I [D] want to be there
[C] When you [D] come on down
[G] I [D] want to be there
[C] come on and [D] take me [G] now

See the sparkled lights
Part of the bitter night
Just like a bitter cloud
Oh you take me now...

[chorus]

bridge:
[D] you can take my life and you can [C] take my days
[D] you can change my love and you can [C] change my ways
[D] you'll never have anything you [C] want to change
[D] until you're coming [C] 'round...

[chorus]
