[G] girl i try to walk past
[C] and i try not to see
[G] just gonna keep on walking
[C] until you notice me

[G] i'm sure i'll never size up
[C] i'm sure you'll never see me
[Em] if nothing [D] else, then girl
[C] please don't ever [D]humor me

CHORUS:
[G] tell me if i'm through walking
[C] tell me it's time to stop and
[Em] i [D] hope you will [C] see
but i'm [D] better than [G] me

girl tell me if i smile
and if i'd ever catch your eye
i know you can't see me
behind that painted smile

i wish you'd reach out and touch me
i wish you'd wish i was near
and if you're gonna tell me, girl
that time is now here

CHORUS

i can never say never
cause i will always try
no matter how unclever
or how my life's a pointless lie

there's just so much inside
that you will never see
there's another self
inside my personality

CHORUS
