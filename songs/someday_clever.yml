title: Someday Clever
---
(Verse 1)
I keep saying, I keep going on.
I keep talking when I'm on what I should not be on.
I keep giving, I keep putting on.
Lies are what I tell myself when you are gone.
Maybe I will just say one more thing.
No!

(Chorus)
Not today, Not today, not gonna complicate the world with all the little things that I shouldn't say.
Not today, not tomorrow, not the next day, maybe never, someday clever I could speak to your face.

(Verse 2)
You keep thinking, you keep wondrin' why.
You keep playing hurt, and holding time.
I say more than I should disclose.
I, at least what I say is the whole truth.
