title: Solid
chords: [E A]

Hold me fast and let me stand
While the water makes it plans
Wandering hills and mountains tall
Washing down, it covers all
Wears down mountains, cliffs, and hills
Tries for me, but it never will
Look at me, I'll never stay
Reach the ocean side someday

[Find my heart a river, let me live forever
By walls of solid stone
The only thing I've known
Find my heart a river, let me live forever
By walls of solid stone
The only thing I've known]

Stand my ground, I'll never change
Let the ground beneath me wash away
Hold my head back as I sit back and fade
Into the tapestry
Cuts through walls of solid stone
I stand by as it washes on
Never gonna move me, never gonna take my place
Let the water have it's way

CHORUS

Broken dreams and solid glass
Forged of sand and recklessness
Sweeps away the emptiness
Broken lies on shattered ground
Build your life on stone by stone
You can't build you life alone
When the foundation's gone
I'm gonna walk through walls of solid stone

Everyone trying to break me down
No one thinks I'll stand my ground
Hold on to the walls of stone
Nothing's firm as my resolve
Break my heart and make my way
Try to tear myself away
Take myself away from here
Even the graveâ€™s afraid of fear
