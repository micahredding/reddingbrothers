title: Over
---
she lifted my arm found the vein running to my heart
instead of cold blood pooling there, she found a new kind of tainted art
she let her colors run dark with red; she left her memories in my mind
she painted colors to get outside; she found a way to paint with life

could it be that she was trying to find a way?

and all the while the night is over
and in my mind the night is over...

she gave it all just like she did for jealousy
like life she bled on the sidewalk, she painted pictures of you and me
and taking her time, she caused my name to be inscribed on the stars
she lost myself - just about the time She found a way to lose her art

could it be that she was trying to find a way?

and all the while the night is over
and in my mind the night is over...

she was there when I walked by that Autumn day
on the street where she used to stand and sell
a vacant void just took her place
she had stopped to find a light, I know she's just blowing in
and now my eyes are open, filled with sights
and she's captor of the wind

could it be that she had finally found her way?

and all the while the night is over
and in my mind the night is over...
