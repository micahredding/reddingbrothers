I look outside see myself in the yard/ Laying down looking up at the stars.
And I think/ I think to myself/ What a wonderful world.

Righteous brother with your place in the sky/ Come on down from on your mighty sight/
You yourself and the other will say/ what a wonderful world.

Hey!
Can you see me when down the sun?
What if I could be a constellation?
What if I could be in the stars?
