Girl I am missin you
It's just something that I've got to work through
I'm trying to fill my need
For your sympathy

I always long to be
With you next to me
And now you're in my dream
Girl you are my caffeine

[ Girl you are my caffeine
You are my disease
I want to live my life
With this malady ]

I feel a lack of you
And I know that I need to be near you
You give off that allure
But you're the only cure

[ chorus ]

My mind is overcome
I can't get back where I started from
My mind may start to dream
So give me more caffeine!

[ chorus ]
