(Verse)
I would never go.
if you would relieve my desperation.
Cause I know it's all in my mind.
and it feels like suffocation.

Wait for it.

I would never say no,
if you would relieve my desperation.
Cause it's pushing on my insides,
I don't want to feel like I'm bound


(Chorus)
Foil my desperation!
Leave me all the Helped one/
Completely in formation/
Foil my desperation!


(Verse 2)

I could be the perfect one
if you would relieve my desperation
Though I'm already the closest to done
and my internal war is almost won.

(Bridge)
All alone in my head
All alone in my head
