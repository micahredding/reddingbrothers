title: Bonny Lass

(Verse 1)
Never a care and never a sorrow,
little lass here in the dale.
You will walk on the path down to the riverside,
every person will stare.

And if a wand'rer should try and harm thee
LIttle lass I will appear.
Should he be vile and make 'vance upon thee
Little lass I will be there.

(Chorus)
If you would like to be my bonny lass,
I will take care of you all of my life.

(Verse 2)
Picking the wild flow'rs grown in the valley,
brilliant sun in your hair.
And a song on her voice, sung with the bagpipes,
Wondrous sounds in the air.

And if a wand'rer should try and harm thee
LIttle lass I will appear.
Should he be vile and make 'vance upon thee
Little lass I will be there.

(Chorus)
