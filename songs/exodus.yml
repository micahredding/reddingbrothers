[E G A]
The moment is ready, the scene has arrived
The sunset is fading, brings light to my eyes
The morning is coming, no slowing it down
And we are a-waiting, treading the ground

She clenches her fist round a locket of gold
Tightens her fingers, loosens her hold
She's waiting for something, to bring it all in
The moment, the Moses, the fire, the wind

CHORUS
Wake me up early and let me go, wake me up

The wind has grown silent, dark clouds in the skies
The tension is mounting, she opens her eyes
The floorboards are pounding, her hand starts to shake
The moment is waiting, she startles awake

My feet stomp the sound, ragged cloth on her wrists
She's cut short her hair, she's biting her lip
Her eyes black as coal-dust, she lets herself go
She takes her first step, one step closer to home

CHORUS
CHORUS

Inside of the morning light, I'm going to run to the borderline
Inside of the morning light, I'm going to fly
Inside of the morning light, I'm going to run to the borderline
Inside of the morning light, I'm going to fly

Inside of the morning light, I'm going to run to the other side
Inside of the morning light, I'm going to fly
Inside of the morning light, I'm going to run to the other side
Inside of the morning light, I'm going to fly

CHORUS
CHORUS
