title: Dragonfly
notes: (Song for Sophia)

I like the rain upon the shore
Bittersweet lift and I want more
A reason for seasons to collide
Crushing the sky

The sun falls on cedars over me
Just like a bird who needs no wings
Beautiful reason for this light
Innocent life

The dragonfly lifts into the sky
Kissing my whole world goodbye
Chasing the stars he fades tonight
Piercing the veil as he pierces the sky
Into the heavens we will fly
Life of a child

Reaching for nature's brightest key
The wisdom to find out what it means
Sophia's the wisdom of the seas
Beautiful life

The firefly lifting off the ground
Shimmers away at the smallest sound
Giving his light to reach the heights
Striving to fly

The dragonfly lifts into the sky
Kissing my whole world goodbye
Chasing the stars he fades tonight
Piercing the veil as he pierces the sky
Into the heavens we will fly
Life of a child
