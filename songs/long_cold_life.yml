title: Long Cold Life

city's not as unfriendly as the stars
staring down at this tiny spark
escaping from my lips into the breeze
making whirlwinds from the smallest seeds

why won't they answer, how long have we tried?
wasting thousands of these tiny christmas lights
and i find myself on a road to rest on old route 99
should i take this route to east or west, or should i take my time?

it's a long cold life
i feel like i belong to you
it's a long cold life
i feel like this is something new
it's a long cold life
i finally had the chance to choose
it's a long cold life
i feel myself fade into you

you watch the clock as you sleep at night
tell me if you ever try to find
as you sleep, you know it's got to be
moving mountains in your sleep, believe
