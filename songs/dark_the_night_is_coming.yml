title: Dark the Night is Coming
chords: [G C]
---
All hands to arise in view, All hands to arise
All feet to move on the earth, Slowly side to side
All feet pound the ground in tune, Faces rise to light
All eyes raise to view the night, All hands reach to sky

**[CHORUS:
Dark the night is coming
Dark the night arrives
And we can't stop running
Til we see the light]**

Bodies moving in the dark, Hands press on the wall
Bodies on this slowly writhe, Press against the cold
All bodies move side to side, All bodies can dance
All skin leaves a warm imprint, Ling'ring on the hands

**[CHORUS:
Dark the night is coming
Dark the night arrives
And we can't stop running
Til we see the light**

**Dark the night is with us
Dark the night is come
And we can't stop running
Til we see the sun]**

We are here to rule the night
We are here to rue the night
We are here to slowly move
Up against the fire

**[CHORUS]**

****Dark the night is with us
Dark the night arrives
And we can't stop running
Til we see the light****

****Dark the night is with us
Dark the night is come
Dark the night is shadow
Slowly lingring on****

**Dark the night is coming
Dark the night arrives
And we can't stop running
Til we see the light**

Oh oh oh, ah ah ah
