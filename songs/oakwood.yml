Sittin' in my house, memories flood my mind
Takin' me back through time
Childhood days, when things were good
A little town, called Oakwood

[Take me back to Oakwood, Texas
Cotton fields and wooden fences
Sawing boards and ginnin' cotton
Those times will never be forgotten
Those times will never be forgotten]

Workin' hard, sunup to sundown
Saturdays, running all over the town
Chasing girls, flirting with women
Running home, leaving them spinnin'

[chorus]

Thursday nights, singing bass
The whole town was in one place
Singing in the church, the singing was good
We were a town called Oakwood

[chorus]

Now I'm in the city, but I'm not a city boy
City living don't bring me no joy
I need the country, I need to be free
Oakwood Texas is where I need to be

[Take me back to Oakwood, Texas
Cotton fields and wooden fences
Sawing boards and ginnin' cotton
Those times will never be forgotten
Those times will never be forgotten
Those times will never be forgotten
Take me back, to Oakwood Texas...]
