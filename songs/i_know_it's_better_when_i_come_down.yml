[B E G#m F#m]
[B E G#m]
[B E G#m F#m]

[G Am Em C]
You've got me figured out I guess
You've got me figured out I guess
Trying leads to nothing
Nothing to confess
You've got me figured out I guess

[G C Em C]
Where eyes meet bodies
And light makes skin so soft
That night and daylight
Will never know
Will never know

When [where?] fire meets concrete
And ice is melting
Away sensation
You never know
You never know

[G C G Em C Em C]
I know it's better when I come down
I know it's better when I come down
All I know is you can be
My surrounding grace

I know it's better when I come down
I know it's better when I come down
All I know is you can be
My surrounding grace

You've got me figured out I guess
You've got me figured out I guess
Sighing [striving?] leads to nothing
And nothing to suggest
You've got me figured out I guess

CHORUS

[A D F#m E]
Oh oh oh oh

[B E G#m F#m]
Oh oh oh oh

[B E B G#m E G#m E]
I know it's better when I come down
I know it's better when I come down
All I know is you can be
My surrounding grace

I know it's better when I come down
I know it's better when I come down
All I know is you can be
My surrounding grace

[B E G#m]
Where eyes meet bodies
And light makes skin so soft
That night and daylight
Will never know
Will never know

When [where?] fire meets concrete
And ice is melting
Away sensation
You never know
You never know

[B E G#m F#m]
Oh oh oh oh
