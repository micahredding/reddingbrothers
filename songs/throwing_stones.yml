title: Throwing Stones
chords: [Bm G D A, Bm G D]

I've got one hand in my pocket and one hand in my face
I've got one stone in my fist, and one stone in it's place
And it's only a reflection of me, yes it's only a reflection of me, yes it's only a reflection of what I need, yes it's only a reflection of me...

[ Throwing stones, ain't what it used to be
Throwing stones, just because I'm me
Throwing stones, I'm tired but I'm free
Until you take me down... ]

I've got one eye look behind me and one eye look ahead
It's protect myself or run scared
And I'm living my life like it's not for me, yes I'm living my life like it's not for free, yes I'm living my life like I'm guilty, yes I'm living my own life like it's not for me...

CHORUS

So take my chains and take my keys
I won't be trapped, I will be free
Throw open the door in the face of defeat
Throw open the gates to my enemies...

CHORUS
