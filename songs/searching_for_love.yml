title: Searching For Love
---
Stuck in the middle of my self-pity, I've been searching for the long way home
Talking myself into trouble, Just can't seem to find enough on my own
That's the way life is, that's the way it seems
Heaven knows I know I've been pulling at the strings
I've been searching so hard, I've been searching this town
I've been working my way down

[I've been searching for love, sweet love
I know that at the end of the love
I've been searching for love, sweet love
I know I'm going to find my way
I've been searching for love today]

Stuck in the middle of night I'm calling, Collect calls on a one-way phone
Rattle of change keeps falling, Tried every single number I've ever known
That's the way life is, that's way it feels
Just like everyone else, I've been spinning my wheels
Watching and waiting as we become a crowd
Waiting just to hear them shout

On the outside staring at the sky, My watch counts down as the stars tick by
Does anyone care, does anyone smile, Does heaven see me walk these miles?
There I go again, question all my friends
Bring it down around myself in the end
I've been working my way to those pearly gates
I think I just heard heaven say
