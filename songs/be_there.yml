title: Be There
---
now that the storm is over
who will overcome
and who will take us to our home
and only time will tell us
who will lead us home
along a different way we know


that's when i fall asleep
and that's when i dream
the lives that we keep
fallin like petals in a stream


i want to be there
i want to be there
i want to be there on my own


when the storm started
we would overcome
losin all we had to give
that's where we left it
into the heart
time we never knew to give

and that's when i started
to overcome
everything that i had known
and only time will tell us
who was there
and who would ever have to say no


that's when i fall asleep
and that's when i dream
who ever knew the time would keep?
i want to be there
i want to be there
i want to be there on my own
