title: My Home is the Road
---
I like the cars I can see out my window
Just about noon, they're all heading to New Mexico
I like the haze I can see in the sunrise
Even though I know it's just the pollution of mankind

A leather bag is too cliche, so I'll take this worn-out suitcase
Hard-shell and tough enough to last me another thousand miles
Thirty years of history, the pieces come together over me
Musty smells and memories - of a million hurried nights

[My home is the road, I can see it out my window, and there she goes...
Running away, running away...my home is the road
I can see, I can see it out my window, and there she goes...
Running away, running away...my home is the road]

Not that good at geography, but this is the land of sea to shining sea
So I'll take my chance, take my time, and take a ride
Out over the western plains - up and down New England highways
Think I just passed California - heading for the Florida keys

[My home is the road, I can see it out my window, and there she goes
Running away, running away...my home is the road
I can see, I can see it out my window, and there she goes
Running away, running away...my home is the road]

Manhattan makes good Kentucky country-side, midwestern states all collide
New York is the light of the world, and I'm just out on a drive
Out on the road, past Albuquerque and Ohio
The river runs through them both the same, the middle of the Mississippi line

Saw Indiana in Disneyland, Niagara Falls in Yellowstone
Ohio runs to West Palm Beach, and all the deserts of Puerto Rico
The oceans and the highways in the middle of Oklahoma
Heading back to the western coast, The Statue of Liberty - rests in Kansas tonight!

[My home is the road, I can see it out my window, and there she goes
Running away, running away...my home is the road
I can see, I can see it out my window, and there she goes
Running away, running away...my home is the road]
