title: Receive

Put it in to my custody/ All your pain, then swell it up for me.
Keep it still, just to get near me again.

I stand up and take it cause I feel like it's mine to receive.

I reach out, grasp to be your confidant,
Push it back once you let go of it.
I loathe, I loathe wan' to help you.

You could have control/
of your complete soul/
I just wanna point the way/
not be your savior.

I wonder how just one man can take it/
Prob'ly can't/ he's prob'ly just fakin'
I want, I want just to be free.

I could have control/
But I just give away my soul/
I just wanna point the way/
But I feel like it's mine to pay.

I stand up and take it 'cause I feel like it's mine to receive/
Oh! God, let this cup pass from me!
I stand up and take it 'cause I feel like it's mine to receive. X4
