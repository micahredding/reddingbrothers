This skin is my skin
These bones are my bones
These feet are my feat
This body is my own

These hands are my hands
They own what I own
While others kneel I stand
Every night while I atone

CHORUS:
This body is no temple
This body is no sacred mosque
This body is no temple
No bleeding sacrifice to God

The open temple steps
The steps that I walked before
The secret the silence kept
The space that I wanted more

You know what the others know
That they have yet to get
You know what the others show
That they haven't found you yet

CHORUS

When I was younger I stood
In the doorway of God's house
Knew the entrance and I would
Live inside it til I found out

My way around I often read
Another world was on the step
Never finding me outside
I stepped out and I find ... what I want to find

CHORUS
