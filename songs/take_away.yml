title: Take Away (I Needed Something)
---
I needed [Am] something
Nobody [G] knows it
Nobody [F] told it to me - to [G] me, to me, to [F] me

[Am C G F] (All along the way)
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh (You better outlast this, better outlast this)

[Am] High, high,   [G] higher than the    [F] earth
[Am] I, I,         [G] I know what you're [F] worth
[Am] Light, light, [G] coming with the    [F] burn
[Am] Fire, fire,   [G] burning in the     [F] earth

[Am C G F] (All along the way)
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh (You better outlast this, better outlast this)

All along the way, there were buttercups blooming in the sun
There were birds and wildflowers singing
All along the way, there was sunshine falling on faces
There were people taking their places in their dreams

I needed [Am] something
Nobody [G] knows it
Nobody [F] told it to me - to [G] me, to me, to [F] me

[Am C G F] (All along the way)
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh (You better outlast this, better outlast this)

[Am G F]
High, high, higher than the world
Light, light, heaven on earth
Wake, wake, for you in my song
Take, take, wonder what you know

Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh

Lord, come on feel me, Come on hold me, Come on know me now
Lord, come on use me, Come on through me, Come on throw me down
Lord, come on to me, Come on bruise me, Come control me now
Lord, come on through me, Come on fill me, Come on hold me down

Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh
Take away, oh oh oh

I needed [Am] something
Nobody [G] knows it
Nobody [F] told it to me - to [G] me, to me, to [F] me
