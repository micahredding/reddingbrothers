As you see it, I must see it, on your way down
As you see it, I must see it, on your way now
Where you're going, I must follow, I must follow, I must follow
Where you're going, I must follow, I must follow now

As you were, swing low
As you are, halo
Like the stars burn cold
As you are, halo

As you see it, I must see it, on your way down
As you see it, I must see it, on your way now
Where you are, I cannot follow, cannot follow, cannot follow
Where you are, I cannot follow, cannot follow now

As you were, swing low
As you are, halo
Like the stars burn cold
As you are, halo

As you were, take hold
As you are, halo
Like the stars swing home
As you are, halo

Halo, halo, halo, halo
Halo, halo!
