title: We Are Getting Louder
---
[G F D#]
When you came in, the door swung open
Flat glass floor, and the ceiling black
When you sat down, the world spun sideways
Never look back, no, never look back

When you moved right, to the other table
Everything moved in the galaxy
When you sat down, the room turned over
Every single thing is cutting free

[G D# F - G D# F - G]
We are getting louder, we are getting strong
We are getting louder, as the story goes, the story goes

When you come down from the light you get on
When you get back to the way they lay
When you let go of the spinning pinwheel
Leave you swimming in the alleyway

When you get back from your grand excursion
When you have things that you want to say
When you tell them all about the freefall
No one understands - not a single phrase

CHORUS

Move to the right now, feet up and down
Move to the left now, bring it all around
You got to take time now, you gotta make sound
You gotta turn loose now, bring it all down

CHORUS

[G D# F]
It's not over until we say
It's not over until we make
It's not over until we take, back the things we used to say
