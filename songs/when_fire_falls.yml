You can [10] be regretting [3] all you're set in
[7] Feels like fire - [5] bound like braces
[10] Round your shoulder [3] pressing inward
[7] See it clearer [5] hard to take

[10] Store enough [3] away, enough [5] away
[10] Store enough [3] away, enough [5] away
[10] Store enough [3] away, enough [5] away

When fire [10] falls, when fire comes [3] on you now
Like you [7] don't know how - when fire [5] falls
When fire [10] falls, when fire comes [3] on you now
You gotta know [7] us and how - when fire [5] falls

Store enough away, enough away (and you take it)
Store enough away, enough away (and you keep it)
Store enough away, enough away (and you need it)

The [10] colors of your eyes made the [3] sparkles all combine
[7] Wish that I could find you with me [5] someday
When I was young, I couldn't resolve - [3] making special marks
On [7] special chalkboards given to me [5] Sunday

[10] But time has made a better man of [3] me
[10] But time has made a better man of [3] me
[10] The fire you [3] desire - let it [5] lead to what you see
[10] But time has made a better man of [3] me

Store enough away, enough away (keep it)
Store enough away, enough away (feel it)
Store enough away, enough away (need it)

When fire [10] falls, when fire comes [3] on you now
Like you [7] don't know how - when fire [5] falls
When fire [10] falls, when fire comes [3] on you now
You gotta know [7] us and how - when fire [5] falls

Store enough away, enough away (and you take it)
Store enough away, enough away (and you keep it)
Store enough away, enough away (and you need it)

When fire [10] falls, when fire comes [3] on you now
Like you [7] don't know how - when fire [5] falls
When fire [10] falls, when fire comes [3] on you now
You gotta know [7] us and how - when fire [5] falls

Store enough away, enough away (and you take it)
Store enough away, enough away (and you keep it)
Store enough away, enough away (and you need it)
When fire falls!
