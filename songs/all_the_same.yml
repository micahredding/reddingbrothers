title: All The Same
---
a sleepy little town called Caroline
a small-town cove and broken bay
an old man drinking cheap wine
and laughing his years away

What does it matter what you do?
What does it matter where you go?
In the end we're all the same,
In the end we're all the same

What does it matter what you say?
What does it matter what you know?
In the end we're all the same,
In the end we're all the same...
We're all the same

It's hard to fight against yourself
Hard to fight someone like you
When every single thing you've felt
Is broken, old, reused, and new...

chorus

I listened to that old man's words
And every word he said was true
Of all the things I'd ever heard
It made me feel alive and new
