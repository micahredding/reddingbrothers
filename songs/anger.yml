title: Anger
---
[Em] I hide my [D] face [Em] From my own [D] self
[Em] Behind this [D] wall, [Em] I hide [A] regret
[Em] I slip [D] away, Look down [Em] At my [D] home
[Em] The storm will [D] stay, [Em] My heart will [A] Know

[And it's almost like [G] Anger in the [D] stormy night
When the [A] rain lashes down and you [Bm] feel the light
Of the [G] world Looking [D] down on you and [A] me
And it's almost like [G] Anger in the [D] stormy night
When you [A] brace yourself and you [Bm] run towards the light,
And that [G] place is every[D]thing you'll ever [A] need]

[Em] I am a [D] fool [Em] And I found [D] you
[Em] I lift my [D] face [Em] You found me [A] too
[Em] I've been [D] awake [Em] I've been [D] asleep
[Em] I've been [D] alive [Em] I've been [A] complete

[chorus]

[Em] I've been turned [D] down, [Em] I've been kicked [D] out
[Em] I've been [D] afraid, [Em] My strength gave [A] out
[Em] So take my [D] voice, [Em] Save it for [D] me
[Em] I had no [D] choice, [Em] I was meant to [A] leave

[chorus]

Let me [G] run [D] once [A] more to the [Bm] place where [A] I am [G] told
Let me [G] ride [D] this [A] shore, 'til my [Bm] body's [A] soaked and [G] cold
Let me [G] find [D] that [A] place where I will [Bm] always [D] want to [G] stay
When my [Bm]body [D]washes [A]up some stormy [Bm]day
When my [Bm]body washes [D]up some [A]stormy [G]day
