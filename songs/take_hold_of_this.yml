title: Take Hold of This
---
[E] When you taste the [G] morning, [A] you can hear it [C] whisper
[E] Anything could [G] happen, [A] early morning [Dm] face
[E] Wade out in the [G] water, [A] see if it is [C] clearer
[E] Everything is [G] watching, [A] terrible [Dm] disgrace

[C] I take [Dm] hold of [E] this, with what you [G] have, with what you [A] had, with what you [C] give
[C] I take [Dm] hold of [E] this, with what you [G] have, with what you [A] had, with what you [C] give


far away the ages, rest out in the fire, pouring on the chase
taking off the nation, overcoming silence, resting for the sacred, lackluster disgrace

rest out in the spacious, far away from ever
never knowing nature's, where there is no face

Come take hold of this, with what you have, with what you had, with what you give

terrible disgrace
face it in a mirror, terrible discomfort
terrible ovation, more than you can face
