title: Can You Believe It?
chords: D C G...A (with verses D F G)

You better bite off just a bit of me, you don't know what you need
Least of all a reason to see, I am true to you
Going to find the bottom of this, I am reckless too
Going to find the bottom of this, make a wreck of you

Never going to see what you need, in the CIC
Never find a reason to be, here in back of you
Reason with the reason I see, I give comfort too
Reason with me reasonably, make you a better you

[Going find myself on the morning flight
Going to hug my knees 'til I see the light
And if I find myself on the other side
I say...Hey, Hey, Hey
Can You Believe It!]

Taking everything that I need, get in the driver's seat
Heading for the piece that I see, get you a piece for you
Biting off more than I can chew, this is what I need
Biting off much more than I knew, this is destiny

[Going find myself on the morning flight
Going to hug my knees 'til I see the light
And if I find myself on the other side
I say...Hey, Hey, Hey
Can You Believe It!]

Bass Riff
Oh, oh oh oh

[Going find myself on the morning flight
Going to hug my knees 'til I see the light
And if I find myself on the other side
I say...Hey, Hey, Hey
Can You Believe It!]

[Going find myself on the morning flight
Going to hug my knees 'til I see the light
And if I find myself on the other side
I say...Hey, Hey, Hey
Can You Believe It!]
