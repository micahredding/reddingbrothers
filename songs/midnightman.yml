title: Midnight Man
---
I see all the people heading for their quiet homes
Shuttering all their windows, turning off their telephones
They drink a little, slip in bed
The sheets wrapping all around their heads
Protecting them from all I see -
The mystery of the stillness of the unbroken nights...

[I'm not midnight man
Don't live in the spotlight
I'm just a simple soul who works the evenings every night
i dont' understand
what the day is like
it's been so long since i started
working the night]

People will visit me tonight
Insomniacs and drunkards, they're all just alike
Looking at me like we both know a secret
that we just can't keep
But no one's gonna know it as long as they sleep

Donut man's truck's rumbling down the road
Bringing donuts to all the people that we both barely know
Sticky sweet freshness too good to touch
When you breath in the smell it's a little too much

Cops stop by in the middle of the night
I give 'em free coffee and a donut if they like
Protecting the whole world from the type of people
Who come in the very next morning



And in the morning all the people will pour in
Never knowing why everything is in its place
Because everything was all okay ... last night
