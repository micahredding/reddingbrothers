Won't you come.
Come into the cove.
Feel the cold.

And the hill
 hill which down you roll.
Won't you roll?

Take the time
time that makes the soul
Man of soul.

(Chorus)
You are the devil and the devil don't bring me down.
Now discover what I have found.
Don't take this mind.

(Verse 2)
Let my mind
mind take control
Don't you know?

And this time
think of what you know.
Don't you know?

You know!

What I tell you
You won't be alone.
Won't you roll?

(Chorus)

I don't try to tell you nothin' for nothin'!
And I say what today for the pay of the way which I pave to take all your pain away.
I won't let you remain there.
Preach on the truth of the truth for the truth cause the it's all that's there to sustains.

Sustain.
pour on all the rain.
All the rain.
