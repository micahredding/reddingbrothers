I wanted to know, how far does it go
I wanted to stay for another day
I wanted to see how much I could be
I wanted to stay for another day

[Now you know your time on earth
Now you know just what you're worth
From dust you are, to dust you came
At least I know I left a stain]

My sweat is a trace, a streak on the lace
A drop to save for another day
My personhood falls onto the walls
Seeping through to another place

Won't you believe it's all a game
I never played cause it's all a shame
Leave it behind, my touches unwind
At least I know, I left a stain

Breathe in and you change
You take everything, into your lungs and out through your taste
The touches they change, the people remain
With every breathe you leave a stain

[Now you know your time on earth
Now you know just what you're worth
From dust you are, to dust you came
At least I know I left a stain]

[
  From dust you are, to dust you came
  At least I know I left a stain
  From dust you are, to dust you came
  At least I know I left a stain
  And now you know your time on earth
  Now you know just what you're worth
  From dust you are, to dust you came
  At least I know I left a stain
  I left a stain...
  I am a stain...
  I left a stain...
