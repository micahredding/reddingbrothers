title: Reaching Out A Hand
---
[G D C D]

[G] tenderly she's bright and stormy
[D] she built a light-house for me
[C] reached out thru the bitter weather
[D] and opened up her arms forever

lost at sea i was sailing-sinking
and she's the only thing that i was thinking
until i saw thru the storm
and i reached out for more

and now she's
[G] reaching out a hand, reaching out a hand to [D] save me
[C] reaching out a hand, reaching out a hand to me [D] now

only for a moment i knew
i had a chance that she would come thru
until my feet touched the ground
and she pulled me from the sound

and now she's
reaching out a hand, reaching out a hand to save me
reaching out a hand, reaching out a hand to me now
