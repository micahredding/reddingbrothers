title: Keep Us Here
---
[C G...G C - Em C G]

[C G]
long dusks, short walks, the night and loud breaches of life
i walked on the water that summer, jumped into the water,
never played football but often was asked
the streetlights cast shadows, the world spun around me,
my convertible leaked but the the tailight was out
spun up and down main street on just a few dollars,
all we needed was sunlight and gas

CHORUS: [G C]
and if they can keep us here
then we won't fly at all
but if they don't leave us here
there'll be no place to fall
we're better off leaving here
than to stay in this place
[Em C G] our reflections shining back from yesterday's face

[C G]
you kissed me in shadows under bridges, we ran down the streets of flaming grace
i hid underneath the water tower, sketched drawings of it all by myself
you heard my sly cry for help, before i knew it, you slowed and fell behind
the end of the pack was where we met,
you were as pretty as grace, fall, and hollywood combined

a trip on the road that i should have taken
i barely knew you but i couldn't forget
wind, song, and history had melded together
this place had torn at life itself

CHORUS: [G C]
and if they can keep us here
then we won't fly at all
but if they don't leave us here
there'll be no place to fall
we're better off leaving here
than to stay in this place
[Em C G] our reflections shining back from yesterday's face

BRIDGE:
you opened up jars and bottles of dreams set on a shelf
the way that they told you to never feel, the way that you knew you always felt
it's days like this when the rain is far away, when i want to stoop and draw you near
the sunlight reflecting from the stones tells me to run far away from here
