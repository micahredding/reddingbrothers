title: Dying On The Inside
---
VERSE 1:
Take my hand if you can
Break me down and I'll lose myself
Follow me if you wanted to play
I'll be okay...

I want to stand by the corner
I want to stand by the riverside
I want to be that way again
I know you know why...

CHORUS:
I'm dying on the inside
I'm living in my mind
I'm never gonna be the one you always want me to be
I need someone to find me
Take me to where I can see that place
That's where I want to be

VERSE 2:
So take my hand if you can
Lift me up and let me stay
Break me down till I feel that way
Then I want you back here to see my face

Reflected in the mirror of time
I couldn't see you and I wondered why
You broke me down and I want to say
I'm away...

CHORUS:
I'm dying on the inside
I'm living in my mind
I'm never gonna be the one you always want me to be
I need someone to find me
Take me to where I can see that place
That's where I want to be

BRIDGE:
Instrumental

CHORUS:
I'm dying on the inside
I'm living in my mind
I'm never gonna be the one you always want me to be
I need someone to find me
Take me to where I can see that place
That's where I want to be
