(e d a e)
i wanna be like the beatles baby
walking down abbey road
carefree and a little crazy
like everyone else i know

wanna live like a legend
in my own time
like the stars on the movie screens
living in black & white

[bm d a e]
ooh...i feel okay tonight
ooh...you're on my mind
trading spaces with the stars tonight
(we'll) see which ones are gonna shine...yeah

wanna regain my childhood baby
and live just like i should
wanna regain my freedom
i wish that i could be good

CHORUS
POST-CHORUS

but this road is too long baby
for me to comprehend
if i were to lose my way
i don't know where i would stand

so i'll take the horizon, baby
as my only goal
and if i reach the end
only you will know

CHORUS
POST-CHORUS
