Let's imagine, let's imagine, all the people strung together end to end
Let's imagine, let's imagine, all the people strung together end to end

If you win, you can be my bitter solace
If you win, you can be my final friend
If you win, you can be my upright tower
My overcoming power til the end...til the end

Repetition, repetition is the secret of the wind
Repetition, repetition is the secret of the wind

If you win, you can be my bitter solace
If you win, you can be my final friend
If you win, you can be my upright tower
My overcoming power til the end...til the end

Feel the motion, feel the motion of the people rising outward like the wind
Feel the motion, feel the motion of the people rising outward like the wind

If you win, you can be my bitter solace
If you win, you can be my final friend
If you win, you can be my upright tower
My overcoming power til the end...til the end

If we win, we can be our bitter solace
If we win, we can be our final friends
If we win, we'll releash this bitter harness
And overcome the darkness in the end...in the end

If we win, we can be our bitter solace
If we win, we can be our final friends
If we win, we can be the upright tower
My overcoming power in the end...in the end

Rise above us, rise up with us all the people strung together in the end
