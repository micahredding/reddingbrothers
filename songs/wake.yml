(Verse 1)
She's as bitter as coffee and bright as the day she was born.
Blonde as the dead grass she cut in her front lawn/
open as a knife blade that slit through the dawn.

(Chorus)
This goes out to the one who comes across me/
on that yellow sky day.
Don't swim in the wake of her anger as it passes/
She's gonna blow you away!
She's gonna blow you away!

(Verse 2)
When the wind in her hair stops blowing me down/
I think I'm gonna leave here.
When the light in her eyes makes the whole world go blind/
will we have nothing to fear?

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Wings of a devil, nescience of a child.
Hair of an angel/
my hope has grown tired.
Her presence is soothing, it shone through my hades unbound!

(Chorus) X2
