title: Broken Limb

I fell hard from the tree, drop from the rope hung high above me.
and the fall makes me buckle to my knees. I try to run but I can't really see.

There's more than this.
Now listen.

You'll hear me say "Go far, go far"
You'll let me underestimate you.
You'll hear me say "Go far, Go far"
You'll hear me say.

Let the text and script run your way, always listen to what they have to say.
never change, never try anew. Always do what the utmost do.

It's not magical. It's simply doable.
It's not limited, it's all I can say.

(Chorus)
