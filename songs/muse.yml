title: Muse
notes: |
  This is a song about writer's block. My problem wasn't having too few ideas, but having no idea of which direction to go with them. So I sat down and wrote this song. And ironically, for a song about writer's block, I wrote it in one pass, totally spontaneously, with no pre-planning or editing of the words. I just hit record, and these are the words that came out.

  We've also done some experimental stuff with multiple takes of me singing. But we used all of them here. Enjoy the weirdness.

Sitting in my room, trying to make the thoughts come together in my head - but they just won't yet
Listening to everything I head - I can try to make it clearer in my head - but it just won't yet
I'm waiting for inspiration to come, waiting for the ink to run from this pen upon my fingertips
Listen to the melodies inside come together in a single straight melodic line

Waiting on a Muse, Waiting on a Muse
Life on the road, how far you go...
Before she get's to you...

Digging deep for every single cliche I can find - Playing those worn-out chords and that old redundant rhyme
I'm rhyming words with themselves - I can't believe what I said - I can't hear this single voice coming through me inside yet
I'm not talking about Greek mythology - Or something you might seek across the open sea
Just look inside for that single thread - The voice that screams louder than all - Are you here yet?

Finally scraped the very bottom - Thanks to these words, cause I forgot them - But I still got them, somewhere
Deep inside my head - Listen for it, but I don't hear it yet - I hear the rain beating down on the other side
I hear the cliched rhymes, I heard the time Beating time, time for me to run - time for me to be done
Time for me to finish this one - but it just won't come
