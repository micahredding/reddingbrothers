title: Man Who Lies
author: Gabriel Redding
---
what do you think about a man who lies?
open-handed in the dead of night
he took the pills and he was soon capsized
overture of a million cries

beautiful pieces of a broken life
many slices in a open file
listing the reasons why he can't combine
so many disparate and separate lives

flutter down from your place on high
part the heavens and you pierce the sky
into a world you don't recognize
i was the reason that angels died

flutter down from your place on high
break the rules and you slide off the sky
into a world you don't recognize
i was the reason that angels died

empty pieces of a broken cup
on a counter-top bottoms up
shards of glass are never ever safe
you took one look and you had lost yourself

many promises are golden-white
littered edges are dark inside
upside down you hang on like a kite
into the trees of deciduous pride
