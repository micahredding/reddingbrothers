title: Child of Yesterday
---
[G Em C Em]

[G] This is a song about [Em] paint
So [C] paint a little picture on the [Em] wall
[G] This is a song about [Em] pain
So [C] paint a little picture of us [Em] all

[Bm] Spread glory on the [Em] roses, my [C] inspiration [Em] closes
I'm [C] in another [D] day

CHORUS
[G] There goes the child of [D] yesterday, [Em] flutter by, [C] flutter by
[G] Where my mind has often [D] strayed, [Em] flutter by, [C] flutter by

This is a song about time
So look up at the shadows on the wall
This is a song about mind
So understand the meaning of it all

[Bm] Spread glory on the [Em] roses, my [C] inspiration [Em] closes
And [C] I'm outside my [D] mind

CHORUS

This is a song about paint
So paint a little picture on the wall
