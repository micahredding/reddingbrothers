title: Foolish One
---
Let's start with the end and go to the first
Start with beginnings, the reasons we hurt
Start with the best and go to the worst
Forget the supper, start with dessert

Do you want to comprehend, the things that others only know
On myself I can depend for my mother told me so

I want you to know

[Can you find a way to be that foolish one?
Living on, living on, living on
Can you find the steps I need to walk upon?
Living on, living on, living on]

Let's hash this out one last time
Baby steps and the reason why
Take my chance, that's the way to fly
Live a life, not live a lie

Don't you want to see me succeed?
Don't you want to be the reason why?
Don't you want to see your name oblique
In the credits of my life?

I can't ask you why

[Can you find a way to be that foolish one?
Living on, living on, living on
Can you find the steps I need to walk upon?
Living on, living on, living on]

Take your hands off me if you can
If you can't I understand
Take your hands off me if you can
If you can't I understand
Take your hands off me if you can
If you can't I understand
Take your hands off me if you can
If you can't I understand

I reach for your hand

[Can you find a way to be that foolish one?
Living on, living on, living on
Can you find the steps I need to walk upon?
Living on, living on, living on]


Living on, living on, living on
