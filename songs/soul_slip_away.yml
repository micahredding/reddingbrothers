title: Soul Slip Away
---
[C G Am F]

[C] Sit here [G] on my back porch
[Am] Watching the [F] clouds go by
[C] Trailing [G] across this [Am] velvet broken [F] sky
[C] If [G] today ain't just [Am] another day [F]
[C] I may just [G] sit here and [Am] watch the [F] rain

CHORUS:
[C] watching my [G] soul slip [Am] away
i'd [F] trade it anyday
[C] for a [G] warmth on my [Am] shoulders
that [F] just won't go away
[C] and the [G] night glows [Am] softly
but [F] i can hardly see
[C] all the [G] dreams youâ€™ve [Am] left behind
[F] stuck inside of me...

...yeah, nah nah nah-nah-nah

sit here on my front porch
watching the sky and thinking
of all the times that life has almost passed me by
tell me stories of a time
that you can't even recall
tell me days when you felt...
felt so wonderful

CHORUS


yeah-heah, whoa-hoa, nah-nah-nah-nah
