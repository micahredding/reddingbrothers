Hello butterfly in my dream.
Leave her alone you said, take it from me.
Hold me back, my mind just screams.
Help me butterfly, come to me.

I've got my very own personal goddess in my head.
Sometimes I tell me I'm misled.
Why's it so hard to catch you when you're not running?

(Chorus)
Hello butterfly in my dream.
Leave her alone you said, take it from me.
Hold me back, my mind just screams.
Help me butterfly, come to me.

(Verse 2)
Delusion sets in as she walks past again.
She talks to me ever happy 'til the end.
Go on, smile away your life like you don't see me.

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Smiling beauty queen. Everyone thinks she's so pretty.
Look at me naive, thinking wit would bring her to me.

(Chorus)
