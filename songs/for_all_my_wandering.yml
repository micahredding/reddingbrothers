title: For All My Wandering

[C F#]
[Em D]
[Em C]
Thousands like this through the world, thousands more and more to come
Resting underneath the branch, taste the truth and pause
For the millions not yet born, for the millions I've become
Rest on me, my consequence is the single one

[C Em]
Oh oh oh
[D]

[C G]    For all my wandering, for all my agony, for all that I will be
[Em D C] Tonight, the light has come
[C G]    For all my openness, for those I choose to bless, for strength when I resist
[Em D C] Tonight, the light has come

Looking forward from this time To the future I become
Endless light will hold me here - No matter what loss
Resting underneath the tree Branches branch to secret leaves
Laying there, look up to see - What I choose to be


[C Em]
Such a beautiful face
I'm a sight to behold
An expanse in space
[Em G - D]
Such a wondrous soul, a wondrous soul
