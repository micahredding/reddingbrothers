title: Lord of Winter

I heard the bells on Christmas day
Listen fool to what they have to say
We played our tune all summer long
But you won't hear til the year is gone

Clarence where's your silver wings
Hear those mighty urchins sing
The world cries out for a savings and trust
But pottersville never misses us

[The rain falls all summer long
The snow falls til the snow is gone
And the wind blows like it wants to pray
Lord of winter help us make through to another day ]
