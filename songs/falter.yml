title: Falter
---
Gonna fall down into my pillow - Gonna lift my head so high
Gonna take down all pretenses - Gonna live like no one can die
Gonna take all myself in the city - Gonna fly down over the town
Gonna watch them, Peace signs in the air - And the people waving signs in the clouds
Gonna take my chance at inhibition - Gonna fall down 3 flights of stairs
To the bottom, where I will find you - Alone and unprepared

Gonna find out if I can falter - Gonna find out if I can fade
Gonna fall down 3 flights of stairs - To the bottom where you lay

In the city - The lion sleeps on the corner
He's bitterly weeping for his lion prey - to come save the day
In the city, people are crying - And the towns they lie to their eyes
And the protest rings thru the city - And the protest rings thru my mind

In the middle of the street where they walk on - They wonder if they ever knew why
In the fields they hold on to shadows - of the reasons why they let themselves dry
Gonna find out if I can falter - Gonna find out if I can fade
Gonna fall down 3 flights of stairs - To the bottom where you lay

Gonna find out if I can falter - Gonna find out if I can fade
Gonna hold on, onto tomorrow - To the restlessness that you've made

And you faltered and you faded - And you've thrown me away
Blessed corner and you edged and wanted to stay - But the parade came by and took you away
All the people they cried - All the people they cried

For the corner that you hadn't wanted - Oh you faltered and wanted to stay
And you let it stand in the shadows - While you went along with the places they played

In the shadows I couldn't find you - In the midnight I found my own friends
In the shadows I lifted around you - In the shadows I wander again

Gonna find out if I can falter - Gonna find out if I can fly
Gonna ride down the steps of Mulai...

Gonna find out if I can falter - Gonna find out if I can fade
Gonna fall down 3 flights of stairs - To the bottom where you lay

Gonna find out if I can falter - Gonna find out if I can fade
Gonna hold on, onto tomorrow - To the restlessness that you've made
