title: Left Alone
notes: The nature of all things is to grow. -micah

There's a little flower growing near your home
But it's not going to grow there no more
Because you plucked from the place where it stood
Left alone, it would grow towards the sun

So you put it in a vase on your shelf
Fill with water just to show how you feel
And you watch it as the leaves turn to gray
Left alone, it would grow towards the sun

One by one all the petals drop and fall
Then you close them in a book on a page
Pieces melt, and they all melt away
Left alone, it would grow towards the sun

[And it fades away
As it strains toward the light
From it's place on the shelf
Close the blinds, shade the light]

There's a little girl playing by the gate
People smile, and touch her pretty hair
They'll preserve her fragile beauty in a frame
Left alone, it would grow towards the sun

So tell her of a place big and wide
Magic things, wondrous things she can know
And lead her by the hand to the door
Left alone, it would grow towards the sun

And they'll put her deep inside of a cage
Walls of concrete, and bars made of bone
Pretty soon walls and chairs will be her home
Left alone, it would grow towards the sun

[And she fades away
As she strains toward the light
Come inside, take your place
Turn your head, shade your eyes]

There's a little girl growing near your home
Pluck a flower for her hair, and she knows
